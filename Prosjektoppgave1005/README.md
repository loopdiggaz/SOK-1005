Too reproduce the project u need to download the datasets locally. There are four diffrent datasets that are being used, for more information see the qmd file in the task1 folder. In the qmd file there are detailed instructions on how to download the data. The task1 folder also contains the data thats being used in the Sales report.  

All the data that is being used are from the James M. Kilts Center, University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
