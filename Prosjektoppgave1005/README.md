These folders contain my Project assignment (canditat number 31).

The project assignment consists of task1 and the sales report. In task1 i combine four datasets into one large dataset. 

Too reproduce the project u need to download the datasets locally. There are four different datasets that are being used, for more information see the qmd file in the task1 folder. In the qmd file there are detailed instructions on how to download the data. 

All the data that is being used are from the James M. Kilts Center, University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
